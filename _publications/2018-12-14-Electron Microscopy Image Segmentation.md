## Background
ISBI challenge is designed for segmentation of neuronal structures in EM stacks. The input images are
all 512*512 pixels, and it is very similar to EM images of connectomes. Usually, connectomes are mainly referring to the brains and the neurons in the brain[1].  

We want to find a better way to segment cells in a cell image, or even a cell volume. The cell has, for
example, core, that looks like cell edges to normal people. If we can find an algorithm or function to solve this problem, we can save much time for experts to annotate cells manually.
