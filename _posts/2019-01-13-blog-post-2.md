1. The blog has been moved to [https://kenway-blog.herokuapp.com/](https://kenway-blog.herokuapp.com/). The reason is that I would like to build on my own, and the support of markdown here is not perfect for me. In the new Blog, math formula and symbols are also supported by MathJax. I take only one class this semester and audit two other classes, that make my time more flexible. I should use some time to deal with aesthetic issues with the new blog.
   
2. I've been always dreaming of having my own blog. Now I realize the content doesn't have to be very hard, just need to be my daily note from school or from work instead.
