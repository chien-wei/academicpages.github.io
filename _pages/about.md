As a CS student of both undergraduate and graduate, Chien-Wei has been in many projects in several fields: mobile apps, front-end web, back-end, software defined network, hardware testing. After his internship experience in Vivint SmartHome in Summer 2018, he decided to focus on his interest--camera. He wants to change how people see the world by working on projects relative to 3D visualization, image processing, and computer graphics.

He first learned computer graphics and OpenGL in Nation Taiwan Ocean University(NTOU). He then worked on visualization projects for 1 year in Advanced Computation Laboratory, NTOU. He decided to pursue his master degree in University of Utah because that is where many great computer graphics experts go to. So far, Chien-Wei have taken courses: Data Visualization(D3.js), Interactive Computer Graphics, and he will take Image Processing, Computer Vision, Data Visualization(Volume Rendering) before he graduates on May 2019.

One of Chien-Wei's goal is to diagnose people's health by using camera in home. Today, people need to go to hospital and let doctors see what wrong with their body by observing. But with the help of smart camera, we can actually know many things about posture problem or some chronic disease or maybe more.
